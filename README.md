# RoyalInsuranceRenual-SampleProject
 
 
Acceptance Creteria
-------------------
Write an application that creates renewal invitation letters to customers from a fictitious insurance company.
It should generate a text file containing the body of the letter for each customer record in an input file. The
name of each generated text file should include the customerâ€™s ID and name, and the application should not
generate a text file if there is already one for the same customer in the output location.
Together with this specification document, you will have received the input file needed to generate the letter
(Customer.csv).
